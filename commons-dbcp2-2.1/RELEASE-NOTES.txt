              Apache Apache Commons DBCP
                  Version 2.1
                 RELEASE NOTES

The Apache Commons DBCP team is pleased to announce the release of Apache Apache Commons DBCP 2.1.

Apache Commons DBCP software implements Database Connection Pooling.

This is minor release, including bug fixes and enhancements. Note that
 one of the enhancements (DBCP-423) is to implement AutoCloseable in
 BasicDataSource, PoolingDataSource and the InstanceKeyDataSource
 implementations.

Changes in this version include:

New features:
o DBCP-426:  Added invalidateConnection method to BasicDataSource. Thanks to Kasper SÃ¸rensen.
o DBCP-427:  Added fastFailValidation property to PooloableConnection, configurable in
             BasicDataSource.  When set to true, connections that have previously thrown
             fatal disconnection errors will fail validation immediately (no driver calls). Thanks to Vladimir Konkov.

Fixed Bugs:
o DBCP-420:  InstanceKeyDataSource discards native SQLException when given password does not match
             password used to create the connection.
o            Correct some Javadoc references to Apache Commons Pool 2 classes that
             have changed names since Pool 1.x.
o            Do not ignore the configured custom eviction policy when creating a
             BasicDataSource.
o DBCP-428:  Unsuccessful Connection enlistment in XA Transaction ignored by TransactionContext. Thanks to Vladimir Konkov.
o DBCP-432:  Changed BasicDataSource createDataSource method to ensure that initialization
             completes before clients get reference to newly created instances.
o DBCP-433:  Fixed connection leak when SQLException is thrown while enlisting an XA
             transaction. Thanks to Vladimir Konkov.
o DBCP-434:  Setting jmxName to null should suppress JMX registration of connection
             and statement pools.

Changes:
o DBCP-422:  Update Apache Commons Logging to 1.2 from 1.1.3.
o DBCP-424:  Made expired connection logging configurable in BasicDataSource.  Setting
             logExpiredConnections to false suppresses expired connection log messages.
o DBCP-423:  Made Datasources implement AutoCloseable.
o            Eliminated synchronization in BasicDataSource getNumActive, getNumIdle methods.
o DBCP-435:  Added property name verification to BasicDataSourceFactory. References including
             obsolete or unrecognized properties now generate log messages. Thanks to Denixx Baykin.
